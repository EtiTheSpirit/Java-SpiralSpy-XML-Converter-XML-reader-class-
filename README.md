#Before starting
You MUST install SpiralSpy to use this! Pasting the binary (.dat) file in will not work!
SpiralSpy can be downloaded at http://spiral.onyxbits.de/download/

#How to get an XML

First, clear the model by going to the top of the list on the right side of the window, and clicking "clear" (Be sure to follow the Spiral Spy instructions before this step!!)
Second, navigate to your desired model after clicking "(none)"
Third, click the "Edit" button at the top left of the window. It should be next to the button where you browsed for your model.
Fourth, CHECK THE MODEL TYPE! (It'll be at the top of the window that pops up)
If the model is...
...Articulated: You're good to go!
...Anything else: Chances of functionality are VERY slim. Sorry!

Go to File > Export to XML...
Save that to your desktop.
Open it in Notepad or TextEdit (or your desired text editor, NOT IE, CHROME, OR ANY OTHER BROWSER)
Copy the contents of that file and paste it into the grey box on my program
Go to File > Convert Model

Copy the contents of the grey box after it is done converting,
create new text document in notepad, paste, and go to "Save As..."
Type in "Model.OBJ" WITH THE QUOTES. If you don't put the quotes, it will likely name it Model.OBJ.txt


Done!
